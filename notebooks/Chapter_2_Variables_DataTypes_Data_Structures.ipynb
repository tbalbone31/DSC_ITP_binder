    "Python is an \"object orientated programming language\", which means that Python everything is an \"object\". Diving deep into what this means is far beyond the scope of this course, but you can think of an object as a collection of **data** (known as variables) and **methods** (known as functions, covered later) that act on those data. Each object is known as an **instance** (like an example of) of a larger group called a **class**, which is the blueprint for what each of those objects are and the methods they hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, consult the **Object Oriented Programming in Python** course on the Learning hub, but ensure that you are fully comfortable and practiced with the content covered in **both** Core parts 1 and 2 in this course. \n",

    "\n",
    "In Python we assign variables using the equals sign ( `=` ), where our label (or variable name) goes on the left and the object we want to store goes on the right. Unlike other languages, in Python we do not have to state the data type of the variable we are storing in memory.\n",

    "Generally, a variable name:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must start with a letter or an underscore.\n",
    "* Can’t begin with a number.\n",
    "* Only contains alphanumeric characters and underscores.\n",
    "* Is case sensitive (MY_VARIABLE and my_variable and My_vArIaBle are treated independently in Python).\n",
    "* Must not have hyphens as these are treated as negative signs in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you may also have your own departmental guidance for naming variables, and if the guidance above contradicts these, always follow your departmental guidelines first.\n",
    "\n",
    "General guidance recommends [Python’s pep8 coding standards](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/#naming-styles) use of lowercase_with_underscores.\n",
    "\n",

These data structures provide us with a particular way of organising data so it can be accessed efficiently. How you store it will often depend on how you want to use it later, so the choice is often an important one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to Python's Object Oriented nature, we create objects to do things to. We’ve already created objects (everything is an object in Python, even just a simple string or integer) but as we move into later sections of the course you may hear these data structures referred to as objects (this is often the case when researching too).\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding a little on the notion of a **class** (or template for objects we create) mentioned earlier, Objects (known as an instance of a class) of the same class may look different but have key elements that are the same. A class of “bird” may have the instances “Norwegian Blue Parrot”, “Budgie” and “Emu”, which all look very different but are all fundamentally birds.\n",

    "Note that this is a slight oversimplification and understanding the ins and outs is not necessary to proceed in this course, but can be very useful, especially as you progress on to more complicated programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects have methods (actions) and attributes (descriptive information about the object) which are often specalised to that kind of object. For example an object that contains text strings can be made lowercase; where as this wouldn't apply to an object containing numbers. These are different to functions (e.g `print()`) that we've seen so far. We'll look at these in more detail later in this chapter."
