    "You may be wondering why we revised comparison and logical operators in the lead up to this chapter of Core Part 2. This is because we use these conditional statements and comparison operators when we create loops (seen in this section) and control flow (seen in a later section). \n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are useful for when we need to repeat a section of code, such as for each piece of data in a list. Often we have large Data Structures which we must apply various methods across, and whilst there are functions that allow us to do this easily, sometimes we must resort to the method of looping.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Python gives us two forms of loops, a `for` loop and a `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use a `for` loop, we take each item in an **iterable** and repeat an action over it. True to its name, an iterable is something we can **iterate** over (a.k.a perform repeatedly) and we have seen many of these already in Core Part 1. For example we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists\n",
    "* Tuples\n",
    "* Ranges (recall `range()` and `np.arange()`)\n",
    "* Strings (Yes, you can iterate over these, character by character!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the syntax for coding these goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`for each_thing in my_iterable:\n",
    "     do_this_action()`\n",
    "     \n",
    "Let's break this down as there are some interesting concepts here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For loops start with the keyword `for` (syntax highlighting is in play!).\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is followed by a variable that refers to each item within the iterable in turn. This is chosen **by you** so using a name that makes sense allows your code to be more readable (for example if you have a list of numbers, this could be **num**).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The keyword `in` is followed by the iterable we want to loop over. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The line is finished with a colon `:`. This tells python that whatever follows belongs to this loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next lines contain the actions that will happen for each item in the iterable. This is indented by 4 spaces or a tab. Most code writing tools will automatically indent for you. To tell Python that something is **outside** the loop, you need to un-indent the code, so that it is effectively a separate statement. \n",
