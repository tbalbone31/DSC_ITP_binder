# Introduction to Python 

### **Course Summary**

This course provides a soft Introduction to the programming language Python, detailing its history, interaction (via an IDE and Notebook software), syntax,
datatypes, methods and attributes. It also details Python's use for Data Analysis with the popular package **pandas** and it's own datatypes such as the 
DataFrame and Series. 

Newly added reference materials introduce the incredibly useful numerical python package **numpy** as well as it's unique datatype, the **ndarray** for use 
in later courses of the curriculum such as **Introduction to Machine Learning in Python**. Previous editions of this course utilised functions from **numpy**
without formally introducing it, so this new addition will make the materials more complete as well as aiding in the overall flow of the course.

The course is split into **core** and **reference** materials, with the core materials being compulsory content for all who take the course (be that self 
learning or e-learning) and reference material that builds upon skills established in the core material but is outside the scope of the learning objectives 
themselves. They act as a great reference point when moving on to more advanced courses such as Machine Learning mentioned above as well as introducing some
more complex techniques for working with DataFrames that wouldn't be considered **essential** content. 

### **Learning Outcomes - WIP**

1. To become **familiar** with programming IDEs & Notebook tools.
2. To **understand** a variety of data types, structures and various ways of operating with them.
3. To **apply** data importing, cleaning, manipulation and exporting techniques to a variety of data sources.
4. To **utilise** methods of aggregation to produce numerical summaries to describe data.
5. To **apply** the techniques introduced sequentially to explore complex datasets.

### **Pre-Requisite Summary**

The **Introduction to Python** course focuses on applying skills throughout whilst building confidence, independence and resilience so that learning can
be continued beyond the virtual classroom. No previous knowledge of Python or Statistics is required to take this course and it provides an excellent 
foundation when starting a Data Science Journey. 

Whilst there are no pre-requisites, there are a number of recommendations for courses to take post completion of this one. In particular, as of 18/08/2021
there is a stand-alone follow up **Control Flow, Loops and Functions in Python** that builds upon the foundation laid by this course. Those who have completed
**Introduction to Python** prior to August 2021 will have already covered this content.

Having completed **Control Flow, Loops and Function in Python**, it is recommended that learners take **Best Practice in Programming - Clean Code** to 
reinforce good practices when it comes to writing code. Programming objects introduced in that course invite alot of bad practice when it comes to writing them, which this follow up course aims to rectify. 

### **Software Requirements**

The course has been written in the following versions of software and packages. It has however been tested with a wide variety of software and package versions.

- ONS Current:
    - Anaconda Suite - ONS current version is *Python anaconda 2020.07.0.0* 
    - Python 3.8 (also compatible with other versions, 3.6 is commonly used in Public Sector)
    - Pandas 1.0.5 (also compatible with other versions)

- Content has also been tested on:
    - Anaconda Suite - Anaconda 4.4
    - Python 3.6
    - Pandas 0.20.1

Guidance on installing the relevant software is contained within the instructions document **Intro to Python Instructions** contained within the 
course materials.
